What it is: A Java specification (JSR 338) for object-relational mapping (ORM).

Purpose: Defines how Java objects map to relational database tables.

Key Point: Itâ€™s just an interface/API, not an implementation.

Example: Interfaces like EntityManager, @Entity, @Id, @Table are from JPA.

Think of JPA as the blueprint for persistence in Java.
