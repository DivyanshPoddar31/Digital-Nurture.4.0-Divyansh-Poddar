What it is: A Spring project that adds another layer of abstraction on top of JPA and Hibernate.

Purpose: Removes boilerplate code (like DAO creation, CRUD operations).

Uses: JPA (via Hibernate) under the hood.

Key Feature: You just define interfaces like EmployeeRepository and Spring auto-generates implementations.

Think of Spring Data JPA as “JPA made easy” using Spring.
